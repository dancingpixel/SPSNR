# SPSNR : A Superpixel-based Stripe Noise Removal for Satellite Imageries

This page provides matlab codes and test datasets to perform superpixel-based stripe noise removal (SPSNR).

The detailed explanation of the algorithm can be read on our original paper as follow:

The authors would like to thank Research Center for Satellite Technology. National Research and Innovation Agency (BRIN) for providing the datasets.

HOW TO USE :
- Run "PSNR_comparison" to perform stripe noise correction on LAPAN-A3_DATASET and to compare the PSNR value between corrected and uncorrected method.
- Run "SSIM_comparison" to perform correction on synthetically noise-added SYNTHETIC_DATASET using different method and calculate SSIM values by using reference image provided in LAPAN-A2_DATASET
