:: HOW TO USE :
- Run "PSNR_comparison" to perform stripe noise correction on LAPAN-A3_DATASET and to compare the PSNR value between corrected and uncorrected method.
- Run "SSIM_comparison" to perform correction on synthetically noise-added SYNTHETIC_DATASET using different method and calculate SSIM values by using reference image provided in LAPAN-A2_DATASET
